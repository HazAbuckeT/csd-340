        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3>Early Life</h3>    
            <p class="intro">I was born December 27, 1990 in Walnut Creek California. I grew up in Stockton, CA
               and graduated from Lincoln High School in 2009. My favorite things to do growing up
               were playing baseball, football and skateboarding. I also enjoyed tinkering with html to create
               my awesome MySpace page (I have since forgotten all of those skills).
            </p>
            
            <h3>Time in the Military</h3>
            <p>I enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2011 and have been stationed a number of places since.
               <span class="sentence">Currently, I serve as a recruiter in Council Bluffs, IA.</span> I have been using my education 
               benefits from the military to pursue my degree in Software Development. 
            </p>

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy being active and participating in sports. I play on a weekly volleyball team,
               as well as soccer and softball teams during their seasons. When I'm not outside, I love Building
               gaming PCs and getting sucked in to both PC and tabletop RPGs.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Family</h3>
            <p>I grew up with a younger sister and two younger brothers. I was the only one to join the military
               and move out of California. I also have a beautiful nine year old daughter, Riley.
